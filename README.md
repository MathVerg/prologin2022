# Prologin 2022 Finale Champion

Here is the code for the champion I wrote for [Prologin](https://prologin.org) Finale in 2022.
The goal was to write an IA that plays (and wins...) in a two-players game that was created specifically for the contest. A description of this game can be found [here](https://prologin.org/archives/2022/final/report). I managed to rank 34th out of 105 contestants.

I choosed to use C++ as a programming language, and to make usage of inheritance in order to write a modular code. Some explanations are given at the beginning of [champion.cc](./champion.cc). Do not expect to be able to run nor compile the code, since the API and Makefile are not made public by the Prologin organization.
